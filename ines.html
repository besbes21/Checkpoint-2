			<p class="C1">My name is Ines Besbes. I'm 18 years old and I am a student at the Faculty of Science in
				Tunis. Jennifer
				Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, producer, and businesswoman. The
				daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an
				uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy
				Leprechaun. Since her career grew in the early 1990s, Aniston has been one of Hollywood's highest-paid
				actresses.</p>

			<p class="C1">Aniston rose to international fame for her role as Rachel Green on the television sitcom
				Friends
				(1994–2004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. Her
				character became widely popular and was described as one of the greatest female characters in American
				television history. Aniston has since played starring roles in numerous dramas, comedies and romantic
				comedies. Her biggest box office successes include the films Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006),
				Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers (2013), each
				of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide box office receipts. </p>

			<p class="C1">Some of her most critically acclaimed film roles include Office Space (1999), The Good Girl
				(2002),
				Friends with Money (2006), Cake
				(2014), and Dumplin' (2018). She returned to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+
				drama series The Morning Show, for which she won another Screen Actors Guild Award.</p>
